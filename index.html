        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly advancing field within the realm of technology that focuses
        on creating intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. It encompasses
        a wide range of disciplines, including computer science, mathematics, cognitive science, and more.<br><br><br>

        At its core, AI aims to develop algorithms and systems that can exhibit traits such as learning, reasoning,
        problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. These capabilities enable AI to analyze 
        vast amounts of data, recognize patterns, make predictions, and automate complex processes with remarkable accuracy and efficiency.<br><br><br>

        There are two primary types of AI: Narrow AI and General AI.
        Narrow AI, also known as Weak AI, is designed to excel at specific tasks, such as image recognition,
        natural language processing, or playing chess. These systems are trained on large datasets and employ
        specialized algorithms to accomplish their designated tasks effectively.<br><br><br>

        On the other hand, General AI, also referred to as Strong AI or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI),
        aims to replicate human-level intelligence across a broad range of tasks. AGI systems would possess the ability to
        understand, learn, and apply knowledge in a manner similar to human cognition. While General AI remains an ambitious goal,
        it has yet to be fully realized and is the subject of ongoing research.<br><br><br>

        AI finds applications in various domains, revolutionizing industries such as healthcare,
        finance, transportation, manufacturing, and entertainment. For example, AI algorithms can
        assist doctors in diagnosing diseases more accurately, optimize financial portfolios, drive autonomous 
        vehicles, improve production efficiency in factories, and enhance personalized recommendations in streaming services.<br><br><br>
